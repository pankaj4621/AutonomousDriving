# AutonomousDriving
# This project is inspired from deeplearning.ai
This project detect objects using very powerful "YOLO model" developed in keras. It can detect objects like Car, Bus, Pedestrian, Backpack and many more i.e upto 80 diffrent classes.
<br>This model is trained on yolo.h5 dataset which can be downloaded from here - http://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo.weights
